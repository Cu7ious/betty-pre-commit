# Automated Betty style checker

This script is a git pre-commit (hook)[https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Customizing-Git-Git-Hooks]. It automates your C code with both `betty-style` and `betty-doc` by checking your files before you even commit them (can save us time!). It runs `betty-style` only for `*.c` files on stage and `betty-doc` for both `*.c` and `*.h`.
